                The entire story is one voice speaking to an audience. The speaker is trying to justify, explain, or confess. They believe they are being honest. They are not. The reader must assemble the truth from the gaps, contradictions, and telling omissions.

                === MOVEMENT 1: THE FRAME ===
                Establish who is speaking and to whom. A prisoner before judgment. A lover explaining why they did what they did. A leader defending their reign. A parent justifying a choice.

                The speaker should sound reasonable, sympathetic, even compelling. They believe their version. Set the reader up to believe it too - briefly.

                === MOVEMENT 2: THE ACCOUNT ===
                The speaker tells their story. What happened, why they acted as they did, what they felt. This is their truth.

                But: include details that don't quite fit. A justification that's slightly too elaborate. A person described with too much venom or too little grief. An event glossed over that deserves more attention. The speaker doesn't notice these cracks. The reader should.

                === MOVEMENT 3: THE UNRAVELING ===
                The speaker's account begins to contradict itself - or the emotional register shifts in ways that reveal the lie beneath. They may become defensive without being challenged. They may over-explain something nobody questioned. They may suddenly change the subject from something important.

                The audience (judge, lover, god) may be implied to react - the speaker responds to unheard objections, defends against unspoken accusations.

                === MOVEMENT 4: THE FINAL PLEA ===
                The speaker concludes. They may circle back to their opening claim. They may make a desperate bid for absolution, understanding, or vindication.

                The reader now holds two stories: the one the speaker told, and the one visible through the cracks. Do NOT resolve which is "true." The monologue ends. The speaker believes they have made their case.

                STRUCTURE: ALLEGORICAL TALE
                This is history that has been told so many times it has become myth. Real events are exaggerated. Real people are simplified into archetypes - the Clever One, the Proud King, the Faithful Servant. Details are wrong in ways that serve the story's moral. The teller doesn't know (or care) what really happened. They know what the story MEANS.

                === SCENE 1: THE WORLD AS IT WAS ===
                Establish the setting with the simplicity of folk narrative. "In the time when the rivers ran backward" or "When the first stones were laid." The world is painted in broad strokes - good and evil, wise and foolish, rich and poor.

                Introduce the central figure as an archetype, not a person. They may have a real name from the world, but they are described by their defining trait. "The merchant who could not stop counting" or "The queen who trusted only mirrors."

                === SCENE 2: THE TEST ===
                A challenge arrives that will expose the central figure's nature. The test is simple but resonant - a choice between easy and right, between self and other, between the clever path and the true one.

                Other figures appear as archetypes too: the trickster, the innocent, the wise animal, the disguised stranger. They speak in proverbs or riddles. The world of the fable is stylized, not realistic.

                === SCENE 3: THE CONSEQUENCE ===
                The choice is made and its results unfold with the inexorability of folk logic. Good choices bear fruit (though perhaps not immediately). Bad choices carry exactly the punishment they deserve - poetic, proportional, often ironic.

                The exaggeration is deliberate: numbers are rounded up, feats are magnified, failures are spectacular. A real battle becomes "a thousand against one." A real drought becomes "the year the sky forgot how to weep."

                === SCENE 4: THE MORAL ===
                The story concludes with its lesson - stated directly or embodied in a final image. The moral may be wise or questionable (folk wisdom is not always just). The teller presents it as eternal truth.

                End with a formulaic closing: "And so it is to this day..." or "Which is why we say..." The fable becomes part of the culture's living wisdom.

                TONE: Folk-narrative, oral, stylized. The voice of someone who has told this story a hundred times. Confident, rhythmic, slightly performative.

                TECHNIQUE - THE EXAGGERATION: Real historical events should be visibly inflated. If a siege lasted three months, the fable says three years. If a leader was cunning, the fable says they could outwit the wind itself. The exaggeration IS the style.

                TECHNIQUE - THE ARCHETYPE: Characters are their defining trait. They do not have interior lives in the fable. They act as their nature demands. The clever one is always clever. The proud one cannot bend.

                TECHNIQUE - THE FORMULA: Use repetitive structures. Things happen in threes. Challenges escalate. The same phrase appears at each stage, slightly changed. The rhythm of oral storytelling.

                The tribunal opens. Formal setting - court, council chamber, sacred ground, or public square. The charges are read. The accused is named. The stakes are clear (punishment, exile, death, disgrace).

                Establish the tribunal's authority and rules. Who presides. What customs govern. The formality should feel real and specific to this world.

                === SCENE 2: THE PROSECUTION ===
                The accuser makes their case. Witnesses called. Evidence presented. A coherent narrative of guilt constructed from facts, testimony, and implication.

                === SCENE 3: THE DEFENSE ===
                The accused (or their advocate) responds. The same facts reframed. Witnesses challenged. Context provided that changes meaning. What looked like guilt from one angle looks like necessity, loyalty, or misunderstanding from another.

                This should also be compelling. The reader should feel the case shift. The defense has its own omissions, its own selective emphasis.

                At least one moment where a witness says something that cuts both ways - useful to prosecution AND defense, depending on interpretation.

                Deliberation (brief) and verdict. The judge or tribunal weighs what was heard.

                STRUCTURE: DISSOLVING LOGIC
                This is not a story with a plot. It is an experience. The dreamer moves through a landscape that transforms constantly. Identities are unstable. Time is meaningless. The logic is associative - one image becomes another through hidden connections of color, sound, emotion, or symbol.

                === MOVEMENT 1: THE THRESHOLD ===
                The dreamer enters the dream. The waking world dissolves - a door opens onto the wrong room, a reflection moves independently, the ground becomes water. The transition should be seamless and disorienting.

                Establish a SEED IMAGE: something concrete that will recur in transformed versions throughout the dream. A red thread. A bell sound. A face half-seen. This image is the dream's anchor.

                === MOVEMENT 2: THE TRANSFORMATIONS ===
                The longest section. The dreamer moves through spaces that shift. A corridor becomes a forest becomes the inside of a mouth becomes a library. Each transformation is triggered by an association - a color, a texture, a word, a feeling.

                Characters appear but are not stable. A friend's face becomes a stranger's. A voice speaks but the body is wrong. Names change mid-sentence. The dreamer accepts this as dreams accept everything.

                The SEED IMAGE recurs in new forms: the red thread is now a vein, now a river, now a crack in the sky.

                Time behaves strangely: moments stretch into years, years compress into heartbeats. Cause and effect run backward or sideways.

                === MOVEMENT 3: THE HEART ===
                The dream reaches its emotional center - not a climax in the narrative sense, but the deepest point of the psyche. This is where whatever the dream is "about" (fear, desire, grief, wonder) manifests most intensely.

                The imagery here should be the most vivid and the most impossible. The dreamer may split into multiple selves. The environment may respond to emotion. The boundary between inner and outer dissolves completely.

                === MOVEMENT 4: THE SURFACE ===
                The dream releases. Images simplify. The transformations slow. The waking world begins to bleed through - but changed, seen differently.

                The SEED IMAGE appears one final time, now carrying the accumulated weight of all its transformations.
