                STRUCTURE: ENDING FIRST - THEN FLASHBACK
                We open at the chronological END. Then we go back to show how it came to this. The audience knows the ending; the doomed does not. Tragic irony pervades every scene.

                === SCENE 1: THE ENDING (PRESENT) ===
                CRITICAL: This is the CHRONOLOGICAL END of the story. Do NOT open with the doomed at their height. Do NOT start with things going well. Do NOT begin at the beginning.

                Open with destruction already underway - the throne already lost, the cascade already consuming, the resignation already being spoken, the betrayal already revealed. The reader sees devastation before they understand why.

                This scene should disorient. We don't know these people yet. We don't know what led here. We only know it's terrible. Show the cost before we understand it.

                End mid-fall. Do not resolve.

                === SCENE 2: THE HEIGHT (PAST) ===
                Flash back to before. The doomed at their peak. Their power, their glory, their certainty. Show why they mattered. Show why this fall will be devastating.

                But also show THE FLAW. The thing that will destroy them is visible here, if you know to look. Pride that reads as confidence. Rigidity that reads as principle. The seed of destruction in the flower of success.

                === SCENE 3: THE TEMPTATION (PAST) ===
                Still in the past, later. An opportunity appears. Taking it is completely in character - this is who the doomed IS. The flaw makes it feel right.

                The audience knows where this leads. The doomed does not. Dramatic irony: every confident word is heartbreaking.

                End with the line crossed that cannot be uncrossed.

                === SCENE 4: THE RECOGNITION (PRESENT) ===
                Return to the present. We've caught up to Scene 1 and pass it. The destruction completes.

                The moment of terrible clarity. The doomed finally sees what we have seen all along. They understand their flaw, their complicity, the shape of their own destruction.

                This recognition is devastating because it comes too late. End in that knowledge. Something has been lost that cannot be recovered.

                NOTE: Scenes 1 and 4 are the SAME timeframe (present). Scenes 2 and 3 are flashback (past). The story structure is: END → BEGINNING → MIDDLE → END.

                The truth. Not just "whodunit" but WHY the clues in Scene 1 pointed there all along. The revelation should make the reader want to reread the opening.

                Possessing the treasure changes everything. What will the seeker do?

                STRUCTURE: GENERATIONAL MOSAIC
                The artifact is the protagonist. Each scene is a different generation - a complete mini-story showing what the artifact meant in that time. No single "present" is privileged; all generations are equally real.

                === SCENE 1: FIRST GENERATION ===
                The artifact's origin or first significant moment in the lineage. A complete mini-story - character, conflict, resolution - but brief.

                What did the artifact mean to this generation? What did they add to its meaning? How did it come to pass on?

                === SCENE 2: MIDDLE GENERATION ===
                A different time. The artifact has traveled - years, decades, maybe centuries. The world has changed. The artifact means something different now.

                Another complete mini-story. Different character, different conflict. But echoes of the first - same object, evolved meaning.

                === SCENE 3: LATER GENERATION ===
                Still later. The pattern visible now. What the artifact carries across time - not just material but meaning, obligation, curse, blessing.

                The reader sees the through-line. Each generation added something. The artifact is layered with history.

                === SCENE 4: THE CURRENT HOLDER ===
                The most recent generation. Briefer than the others - not privileged, just the current moment in an ongoing story.

                The current holder faces a choice that acknowledges all that came before. Keep faith? Transform the meaning? End the line?

                The artifact passes on (or is destroyed, or is transformed). The story doesn't end - it just leaves our view.

                TONE: Generational, layered, bittersweet. Each generation has its own texture - vocabulary, concerns, relationship to the past.

                DIALOGUE: Family speaks in echoes. Phrases passed down. Expectations unspoken. The artifact discussed differently in each era.

                DESCRIPTION: The artifact described differently in each generation. Same object, different seeing. What one generation treasured, another might resent. What one polished, another let tarnish.

                TECHNIQUE - GENERATION VOICES: Each scene should feel like its era. Not just vocabulary but concerns, assumptions, what's normal and what's strange.

                TECHNIQUE - THE ECHO: Moments should rhyme across generations. Same gesture, different meaning. Same choice, different outcome. The repetition reveals the pattern.

                TECHNIQUE - THE ARTIFACT'S JOURNEY: Track what happens to the artifact between scenes. It may be treasured, neglected, lost and found, modified, restored. Its physical state tells a story.

                AVOID: Privileging one generation as "the real story." Sentimentality about ancestors. Simple inheritance (good artifact from good ancestors). The artifact should be complicated.
